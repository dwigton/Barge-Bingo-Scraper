Barge Bingo Scraper
===================

The Barge Bingo Scraper is a visualization tool for the
Games of Barge Bingo on nasaspaceflight.com. The idea
is to vote for a square in the NSF forums. Each square
represents a location on Spacex's 
_Just Read The Instructions_ Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship
or ASDS

The Scraper reads the thread and tallies the votes, 
displaying them on an image of the barge. Missed votes 
are also listed with the reason they were rejected.
