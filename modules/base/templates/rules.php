<h2>Barge Bingo Rules</h2>
<ol>
<li>The game is open to any NSFer, simply claim your square on this thread by listing its letter and number coordinates by letter first.</li> 
<li>The person who claims the square closest to where the F9 center engine is if the stage lands successfully will be the winner. In the event of a landing like CRS-5, the ASDS square in the center of the greatest visible damage or with the largest wreckage on it when returning to port will be the winner. Should the rocket miss entirely, there will be no winner (just like the EDL team ;))  but if you claimed a water square and it can be determined where the splashdown happened in relation to the barge, you will get the prize.</li>
<li>Due to popular demand, only one entry per player, PERIOD.</li> 
<li>In the event of two or more players claiming the same square, the one with the earliest time stamp owns the square.</li> 
<li>Any edits to an entry are automatically disqualifying.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each square is roughly the size of a Merlin engine bell and final landing location will be determined from all of the pictures that will be undoubtedly shot of the triumphant return of the stage aboard the ASDS. Any disputes will be judged solely by me and are final.</p>

<p>Good luck players and SpaceX!</p>

<p>The game is all in fun, and the prize is of quite low value but cool.</p>

<p>THE PRIZE NOW INCLUDES A FREE YEAR OF L2 COURTESY OF CHRIS!!!</p>
